# CPSC210 Personal Project

## Typing Speed Test

### *Introduction*
For this project, I would like to create a typing speed test
that is able to generate random words that allow user to test 
their own typing speed. This project allows anyone to put their
typing skills to a test. This project interests me 
because there is a high flexibility on how the project works,
as well as many possible functions you can add.
The project is also challenging as it requires to take in lots
of different user inputs.

***User Stories***:
- As a user, I want to be able to choose between different lengths
of the test
- As a user, I want to be able to view the previous high score
- As a user, I want to be able to distinguish correctness through
different colours
- As a user, I want to be able to view my WPM (words per minute) 
and CPM (characters per minute)
- As a user, I want to be able to add and view my previous speeds
and date the test was ran in a list to see my improvement
